# School District Analysis with Pandas in Jupyter Notebook
## Overview of Project
This project is a Pandas analysis in Jupyter Notebook of a school district of 15 different high schools. The minimum and maximum high school student populations are 427 and 4976, respectively, with a student dataset of 39171 rows by 7 columns and a school dataset of 16 rows by 5 columns. The code, written in Python language, utilizes multiple dataframes to conduct various analyses of the school district. Additionally, due to issues with some of the student names and some of the student scores recorded, this code utilizes various methods to replace values in dataframes.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to clean and adjust the student dataset, then provide various analyses of student and school performance across the school district. Some student names were entered with prank suffixes or prefixes, such as "PhD", that needed to be removed in order for the student data to integrate without issues for the school district.
